## 1. Parch and Posey Database <a id = 'project'></a>
The database Parch and Posey has following data model:

![Datamodel](https://github.com/KEVIN-VN642/SQL-Structure-Query-Language/blob/main/Parch_and_Posey_Database/datamodel1.png)

The structure query file 'parch-and-posey.sql' has 16430 lines of code to generate five tables and then insert data into them (here I used Postgresql). The file can be viewed or editted by notepad application.
By creating a PostgreSQL database in your local computer or in the cloud, you can experiment with different types of SQL command. This is a good source to improve your SQL skills (https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--cd0023)

## 2. Advanced SQL with Python <a id = 'other'></a>
We use Python to access to the SQL database and perform various advanced queries from Python instead of working directly in the database.
